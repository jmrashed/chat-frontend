# Real-Time Chat Application (Client)

This is the client-side of a real-time chat application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). The project is designed to enable seamless and efficient communication with real-time updates.

git clone https://github.com/jmrashed/chat-frontend.git
cd chat-frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

You can start editing the UI by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will automatically update as you make changes.

## Features

- **Real-Time Communication**: The chat application allows users to communicate in real time.
- **Optimized Performance**: Leveraging Next.js features, the application is optimized for performance and responsiveness.
