This is the client-side of a real-time chat application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). The project is designed to enable seamless and efficient communication with real-time updates.

## Related Repositories

**Backend Server**: For the complete chat application experience, you'll also need the backend server. Check out the [Chat Backend Repository](https://github.com/jmrashed/chat-backend) which provides:
- Real-time Socket.IO communication
- User authentication with JWT
- File sharing capabilities
- MongoDB integration
- RESTful API endpoints
